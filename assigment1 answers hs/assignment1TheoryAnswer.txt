Q4.
The difference between ++i and i++ is that -

++i increments the value first and then return it
i++ return the value first and then increments it
for example--

int i = 5;
int j = ++i;
System.out.println("i: " + i + " j: " + j);

The output will be:
i: 6 j: 6


int i = 5;
int j = i++;
System.out.println("i: " + i + " j: " + j);

They will produce different output.
The output will be:
i: 6 j: 5



Q5.
We can use the && operator to join two conditions together in the for loop.

for( initialization ; condition1 && condition2 ; increment)

Example:
for (int i = 1, j = 10; i <= 10 && j > 0; i = i - 1 , j = j-1) {
     System.out.println("Inside For Loop");
 }



Q6.
yes, you can use a double variable as a loop-control variable in a for loop, especially if you want to loop through fractional 
values or increment by fractional values.
But For counting loops it is best to use an integer for the loop control variable because floating point numbers are not always exact.
Your loop might not iterate through the values you expect because of rounding errors. 
For example, 0.1 is always slightly wrong when represented using floating point, no matter how many bits are used.



Q7 .
No, We can always rewrite a for loop as a while loop, and vice versa.

<init>
while (condition) {
...
<increment>
}

is equivalent to:

for (<init>; <condition>; <increment>) {
...
}
